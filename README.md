# Data-Science_Projects

This repository holds some of my personal projects which I've done
over the last few months.
Currently, they're classified into below categories:

 1. Complex and original data science project containing:
    web scraping, data cleaning, exploratory analysis, 
    model building and optimization: **PEH_Classifier**.
    
The aim of this project is to classify hair products into 3 categories 
    according to PEH balance based on the ingredient list.

 2. Web Scraping and data cleaning project: **Data_science_salary_predictions**
    
The project contains web scrapped data from the glassdoor website with salary ranges.
Dataset was cleaned and new features were extracted to prepare a dataset
for future predictions. Min-max salary, company name, job state, and
encoded skills: everything ready to start building ML model.

 3. Dimensionality reduction techniques comparison - **Dimensionality_reduction**
    
Used different classification models to achieve the most accurate classifier
on high dimension dataset. Investigated how dimensionality reduction
algorithms affect accuracy and learning time and make the dataset more
understandable to the business.



 4. Classification problem with different classifiers and ensemble learning :
    **Ensemble_learning_with_mushroom_dataset**
    
    
Use different classifiers and their ensembles to recognize poisonous
and edible mushrooms by their attributes. Use different accuracy metrics
and classification reports to assess classifier accuracy.
Examine feature importance for different algorithms.

 5. Classification problem with different accuracy metrics
    and learning curves: **Mushroom_classification**
    
Build mushroom classifier with the highest precision and
find the most indicative features.
