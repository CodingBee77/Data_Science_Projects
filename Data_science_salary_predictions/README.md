**Purpose**

Collect and prepare data for a salary prediction in data science. Test
Selenium as a tool for a web scraping.

<summary>**Part 1 - Web scraping**</summary>
- Selenium is not a good tool for web scraping. It is manly used
for any activity automatization on a websites. As webscraper it's a little bit
slow, problems with finding particular element come up. There are problems with
repeatability because of pop up windows, different element dimensions depending on
a website version etc. In comparison with another webscraping tools, Selenium
has a lower efficiency.

Code for a glassdoor web scraper was based on a code and article from Toward Data
Science website written by Mr. Ã–mer Sakarya. Link to the article and the repository
